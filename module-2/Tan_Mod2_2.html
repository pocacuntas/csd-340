		<p class="intro">My name is Tatiana Tan but I like to go by Tia. I live in San Diego, California with my dog named Pepper. I work two jobs currently and I am enrolled in this program. I got my degree in Kinesiology with an emphasis in physical therapy before I decided to change my career paths. I work at a major hospital here in San Diego and I also work at the makeup store Ulta Beauty. </p>
